## melakarta-ragas
The 72 Melakarta Ragas of Carnatic music expressed in the form of interval ratios, in .scl files. 

### Currently in good order!
or so it seems...

### Intended purpose
The intended purpose of these files is to bring this particular collection of ragas to the .scl format. The original goal was to benefit modular synthesizer users who require concise and well-organized .scl files to sequence notes.

### Check the [wiki](https://github.com/alliums/melakarta-ragas/wiki) for information about this project and future goals.
Long live open source!
